# DeepLearningProject-image_classification

This project demonstrates image classification for the detection of deep weeds using deep learning techniques with TensorFlow.

## Dataset
The "Deep Weeds" dataset from tensorflow is used for training and evaluation. It consists of 17,509 images capturing eight different weed species native to Australia in situ with neighbouring flora. 

## Requirements
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Datasets
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- numpy
- seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets matplotlib pandas

3. Run the script:
python ADN_rps.py

4. Training Process
- The script loads the dataset and performs data preprocessing.
- (will be updated) 

5. Evaluation
- The trained model is evaluated on the test set.
- Test accuracy and loss are reported.

6. Saving the Model
- The trained model is saved to the "(will be updated)" directory.
